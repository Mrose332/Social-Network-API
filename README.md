# Social-Network-API
NoSQL Challenge: Social Network API


## Description
This application utilizes MongoDB to store data for my social media application. For this project, I created a back-end system that allows users to perform CRUD operations. The client can create new users for the social media application. The client can create thoughts  and add reactions to thoughts.
